1. There is no utility in uploading/committing the '.exe' files which are created when a CPP program is executed.
2. "std::endl" is used to print the newline character.
3. Programs are compiled using the following syntax
   'g++ -std=c++20 program_name.cpp -o program_name.exe'
4. To see the output, we use the following command format: './program_name.exe'
5. '//' is for single-line comments while '/* ... */' is for multi-line comments
6. Nesting the multi-line comments is not allowed.

   (a) Run-time Errors
   (b) Compile-time Errors
   (c) Warnings
8. A statement is a basic unit of computation in C++ program. It ends with a semi-colon.
