# C++

Self-learning C++ 

Everything that was learnt was through the YouTube channel of `freeCodeCamp.org` and the course of `
C++ Programming Course - Beginner to Advanced`

## The course has been divided into 9 broad sections:
### 1. Comments: 
Comments are used to document and explain C++ code for human readers. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect program execution. Proper comments improve readability and long-term maintainability of programs.

### 2. Core Language, Standard Library and STL: 
The core language defines the syntax, data types, control structures, and fundamental features of C++. The standard library provides reusable components such as input/output, strings, and utilities. The STL offers generic containers, algorithms, and iterators for efficient data handling.

### 3. C++ Developer WorkFlow: 
The C++ developer workflow includes writing source code, preprocessing, compiling, linking, and executing the program. It also involves debugging, testing, and using compiler options to control warnings, standards, and optimizations.

### 4. Data Input and Output: 
Data input and output in C++ are handled using stream-based mechanisms. Standard streams allow programs to read input from the user and display output or errors to the console in a controlled and formatted manner.


### 5. Errors: 
Errors in C++ can occur during compilation, linking, or execution. They indicate syntactic issues, missing definitions, runtime failures, or logical mistakes in program behavior. Understanding errors is essential for debugging and writing reliable code.

### 6. Execution Model: 
The execution model describes how a C++ program runs in memory. It explains function calls, control flow, variable scope, and the use of stack and heap memory during program execution. 

### 7. First C++ Program: 
The first C++ program introduces the basic structure of a C++ application. It demonstrates the use of headers, the main function, statements, and how a program starts and terminates.

### 8. Statements and Functions: 
Statements define individual actions performed by a program, while functions group statements into reusable units of logic. Together, they control program flow, enable modular design, and improve code clarity.

### 9. Summary: 
This section consolidates the fundamental concepts of C++ covered in the course. It helps reinforce understanding and prepares the learner for more advanced language features and programming techniques.
